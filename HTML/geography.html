      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <p>
        On Monday the 11th of March we will be experiencing quite a cloudy day!
        With highs of 10 degrees Celsius or 50 for my fellow Fahrenheit folks
        (we love America), and lows of 7 degrees Celsius or again 45 for my
        Fahrenheit folks you are going to need your extra fluffy coats to keep
        warm as there will also be some North-West 8.9-mile winds! Humidity
        levels will be around 87% and rainfall will be about 0.3mm. Now that's
        out the way, let's move on to Tuesday.
